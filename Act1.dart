Input:

void main () {
  String greeting = "Welcome";
  String user = "Alice";
  
  print ("$greeting, $user!");
  dynamic userDynamic = 25;
  
  print ("$greeting, $userDynamic");
  
  
}


Output:

Welcome, Alice!
Welcome, 25


Explanation:

manipulating dynamics offers enhanced flexibility in my code because 
the type of the variable can change during the execution without causing 
compilation problems.
